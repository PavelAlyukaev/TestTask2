Description
A convex polygon (closed polyline) is given in 2D by the list of nodesâ€™ coordinates.
Implement an algorithm that searches all axes of symmetry for this polygon or reports that
the polygon is non-symmetric.
Input-output
The algorithm should be framed as a console application:
1. Input (command line options): name of text file containing coordinates of nodes;
2. Output: pairs of points defining the axis of symmetry.
